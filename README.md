This project is the first step towards building a full web application: The AirBnB clone.

it is very important because it serves as the back-end of other project: daatabase storage, API, front-end integration...

# synopsis

The console

This software is a command interpreter similar to a linux shell but limited to a specific use-case; management of objects in the AirBnB Clone:

## Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new place)
## Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc..
## doing operations on objects (counts, compute stats, etc..)
## Updating attributes of an objects
## Destroying an objects

it can work in two different modes:

interactives and Non-interactives.
